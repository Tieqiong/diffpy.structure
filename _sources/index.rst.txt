diffpy.Structure - simple storage and manipulation of crystal structures

The diffpy.Structure package provides objects for storing atomic
coordinates, displacement parameters and other crystal structure data.
diffpy.Structure supports import and export of structure data in several
structure formats such as CIF, PDB, xyz.  It provides conversion
between fractional and absolute Cartesian coordinates, functions for
symmetry expansion from asymmetric unit and generation of symmetry
constraints for atom positions and displacement parameters.  diffpy.Structure
includes definitions of all space groups in over 500 symmetry settings.

To learn more about diffpy.Structure library, see the examples directory
included in this distribution or the API documentation
